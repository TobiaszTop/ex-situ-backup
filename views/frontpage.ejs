          Word ex-situ comes from Latin and translates to off-site, and means that individuals of targeted endangered species are bred in captivity, with the intention of future reintroduction into their natural habitat. Captivity greatly affects animals, so the way we take care of them must be cautious, to minimize negative effects.

          Currently the earth is undergoing extinction of species on vary big scale. It is natural process for certain
          amount of species to go extinct. However, in the history of the earth, some events occurred when rate
          of species going extinct was far greater than usually. We call those event mass extinctions. This term
          describes events when more than 75% of species disappear from the earth in relatively short time. Many
          studies lead to believe that earth is undergoing next mass extinction now.

          As opposed to previous extinction events which were caused by natural factors like eruption of super
          volcano current situation is caused by humans, and therefore we have obligation to solve this problem.
          Disappearance of species results in loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity (biological diversity) is definition of
          variety of life forms.
