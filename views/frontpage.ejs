        The term ex-situ comes from Latin and can be directly translated to off-site. Ex-situ conservation means that
        that individuals of animals are taken into captivity with intent of reintroduction back into natural
        habitat in the future.

        Recently, the ex-situ approach gained popularity as some breeding programs successfully reintroduced
        species into the wild, and more breeding and reintroduction programs are being initiated as a tool of
        saving endangered species and stopping loss of biodiversity. Good examples of successful ex-situ
        conservation projects involved species such as Giant panda, California condor, European Bison.

        Currently the earth is undergoing extinction of species on vary big scale. It is natural process for certain
        amount of species to go extinct. However, in the history of the earth, some events occurred when rate
        of species going extinct was far greater than usually. We call those event mass extinctions. This term
        describes events when more than 75% of species disappear from the earth in relatively short time. Many
        studies lead to believe that earth is undergoing next mass extinction now.

        As opposed to previous extinction events which were caused by natural factors like eruption of super
        volcano current situation is caused by humans, and therefore we have obligation to solve this problem.
        Disappearance of species results in loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity (biological diversity) is definition of
        variety of life forms.
